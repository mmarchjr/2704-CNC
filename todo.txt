annoying bug fixes:
- automatic save when editing is finished

- finish optimization controller
    - test init method
    - save new plate contours automatically
    - try stb_rect_pack for now
    - output preview
- try different db implementations, figure out server hosting
- refactor redundant controllers etc, remove repetitive functions
    update serialization logic in plate controller, or take out if its not necessary

necessary considerations in readme:
- db hosting
- actually install on separate system w/o required libs etc.
- layout generation (implement feature)
