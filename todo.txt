annoying bug fixes:
- automatic save when editing is finished
- cannot convert string to float (unit conversion better exception check)

todo:
- add tolerance margin for plate edges
    refactor bin class to apply better - think through thoroughly
- add tolerance margin for drill/mill bits
- save updated contours to plate upon completion

- make json text more readable
- write proper help text
- fix readme stats images, add updated functionality
